# Sprint: Platform Security

## Epic: MOBL-1 iOS Platform Update

### Story: MOBL-28 Spike: Does site load in <1s when user volume exceeds 20k?

* Assignee: Alana Grant
* Status: To Do

As a mobile app user, I want the site to load in less than 1 second even when there are more than 20,000 concurrent users, so that I have a fast and responsive experience regardless of user volume.

This is a 2 day spike to make sure the site loads <1s when there are more than 20k users. The customer MediHalon is expected to reach 20k users before the end of this year.
