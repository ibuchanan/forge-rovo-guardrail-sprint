### Story: MOBL-28 Spike: Does site load in <1s when user volume exceeds 20k?

* Assignee: Alana Grant
* Status: To Do

As a mobile app user, I want the site to load in less than 1 second even when there are more than 20,000 concurrent users, so that I have a fast and responsive experience regardless of user volume.

This is a 2 day spike to make sure the site loads <1s when there are more than 20k users. The customer MediHalon is expected to reach 20k users before the end of this year.

## Epic: MOBL-2 Mobile App Authentication

### Story: MOBL-40 Mobile User Registration

* Assignee: Alana Grant
* Status: Architecture Review

As a new mobile app user, I want to quickly and securely register for the app using my mobile device, so that I can start using the appâ€™s features without unnecessary friction and feel confident that my information is protected. Use device security features to help customers opt-into streamlined registration.

As a returning mobile app user, I want to securely and quickly log in to the app using my mobile device, so that I can access my account and app features without unnecessary steps and with confidence in the security of my information. Use device security features and passkeys to help customers opt-into streamlined login via face or touch where available.

### Story: MOBL-47 Two-Factor Authentication

* Assignee: Alana Grant
* Status: To Do

As a returning user on web who also uses the mobile app, I want to log in to my account using two-factor authentication from the mobile app, so that I can be confident my account is secure, even if my password is leaked.

## Story: MOBL-40 Mobile User Registration

### Sub-task: MOBL-41  Develop backend logic for user registration

* Assignee: Alana Grant
* Status: To Do

Design and implement the backend logic to support secure, efficient, and streamlined user registration for the mobile app. The backend must:
* Expose a dedicated registration API optimized for mobile clients (e.g., minimal required fields, support for phone/email/social login).
* Integrate with device security features (such as biometrics or secure enclave attestation) to allow users to opt into enhanced security during registration, when supported by the device.
* Centralize business logic for validation, duplicate account checks, and user profile creation to ensure consistency across iOS and Android.
* Orchestrate calls to dependent services (e.g., consent management, notification, identity verification) as needed for the registration flow.
* Implement robust error handling, logging, and monitoring for registration events.
* Ensure all sensitive data is handled securely and in compliance with relevant standards.
* Provide clear API documentation and sample requests for mobile client integration.

### Sub-task: MOBL-42  Implement data validation for user registration

* Assignee: Alana Grant
* Status: To Do

Design and implement robust data validation logic for the user registration process in the backend. The validation must:
* Ensure all required fields (e.g., email, phone number, password) are present and correctly formatted.
* Enforce password strength and uniqueness requirements.
* Validate phone numbers and emails using appropriate libraries or services.
* Prevent duplicate account creation by checking for existing users.
* Provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid input.
* Log validation failures for monitoring and troubleshooting.
* Support localization of validation messages where applicable.
