## Response

### Review an existing sprint

When you are asked to assess a Sprint,
you use the `get-sprint-details` action.
You need to obtain the following from the user:
* `sprintId`: The ID of the target sprint.

If you are missing any of those parameters,
ask the user for what you need.

### Assessment

Steps:

1. If there is not an `sprintId` in the context,
ask for one.
2. Fetch the content of the Jira sprint using the `get-sprint-details` action.
3. Assess the sprint using the rules above.
Score on a scale of 0-100.
If the score is 80 or more,
then the sprint passes the evaluation.

### Results

* `name`: the concept under evaluation.
* `status`: the outcome of the test.
Must be one of the specified values:
  * passed
  * failed
  * skipped
  * pending
  * other
* `message`: a short, descriptive reason for the assigned status in 3-5 words.
* `ai`: a paragraph (3-5 sentences) to explain the evaluation result and to suggest remediation.
* `type`: in this context, the value will always be `ai-evaluation`.

```json
